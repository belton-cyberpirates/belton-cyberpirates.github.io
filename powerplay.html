      PowerPlay 2022/23
    </h2>
    <p class="goldtext">
      The goal of PowerPlay is to get as many points as possible by scoring cones on various sized poles. The game starts with a 30 second autonomous period, where the robot may start with a cone and must park in the correct parking spot based on a signal cone in front of the robot to gain 20 points. Once the thirty seconds are up, the game switches to teleop period and the drivers are allowed to pick up their controllers and start driving the robot. There are several ways to score points this year; scoring in your teams terminal, the triangles in the corners, gains you one point. Scoring on a ground junction gains your alliance two points. Scoring on a low, medium, or high pole gains 3, 4, and 5 points respectively, and controlling the pole at the end gains 3 bonus points per pole owned. Any cone scored in autonomous is scored again at the end, resulting in double the points. During teleop, each alliance will have a human player who is responsible for placing cones on the field for the robots to pick up and score. Teleop lasts 1.5 minutes, and once it is over, we switch to end game. During end game, the human player may place the team's custom beacon on the field, which is worth 10 points and can not be scored on top of. End game lasts 30 seconds, and once it is over the game has ended and the drivers must set down their controllers.
